      <h2>Dahg</h2>
      <h3>By Cecily Madanes, Tiffany McCoy, <br>and Timmy Renato</h3>
      <p>The jet door opens. A female voice comes over the loudspeaker and says "Welcome to Hammer Island" in English and Brazilio Creole.</p>
      <p>The airlock releases. Within seconds you feel the tropical humidity.</p>
      <p>Still groggy from the flight, you start down the tarmac and see Teffa waiting for you.</p>
      <button id="introChoice"></button>
    </div>

    <div id="1" class="hidden">
      <p id="t">So good to see you! How long has it been since we were sent to the same site? We'll have to catch up later. I'm supposed to take you to your first location ASAP. You know how it is.</p>
      She hands you a tablet
      <p id="t">Your technical brief pretty straightforward. Use the tablet map to get back when you're done. </p> 
      <p>You ask if she knows what you're dismantling.</p> 
      <p id="t">Ha! I never do anymore.</p> 
      <p>Her laugh can't hide the pragmatic surrender common to Monseed engineers.</p>
      <button id="choice1"></button>
    </div>

    <div id="2" class="hidden">
      <p>Teffa leaves you at your first location. It's only a mile from town, but already thick jungle. </p> 
      <p id="melted">The metal box you'll be working on comes to your waist on one side because it's lopsidedly sunken into the ground. There's a greasy bolt on its access door. It seems to be melted on.</p><br>
      <button id="choice2" class="hidden"></button> 
    </div>

    <div id="3" class="hidden">
      <p>You turn around and there is a dinosaur, gray with a long neck, about seven feet tall. It's eyes are black and large.</p> 
      <p>The dinosaur brings its nose to your fingertips. He likes you and wants to be pet.</p> 
      <p>You love reptiles. Go on, touch him.</p>
      <button id="choice3"></button>
    </div>

    <div id="4" class="hidden">
      <p>He likes you. Who knew the island fauna would be so charming?</p> 
      <p>You smile at him and say, "I'm going to call you Dahgi!"</p> 
      <p>You check the brief on your tablet. You've been asked to go to the village and wait for instructions.</p>
      <p>The original brief had called for more actions, but stops like these happen all the time.</p>
      <button id="choice4"></button>
    </div>

    <div id="5" class="hidden">
      <p>You start walking towards town and the Dahgi follows you closely.</p> 
      <p>He dips his neck to the earth beside you and retrieves a small box. It wasn't yours... Someone must have dropped it. It's a distortion box.</p>
      <p>He puts his head against your hand. He wants to be pet.</p> 
      <p>A sweet giant with an eye for circuit boards? This one's a keeper.</p>
      <button id="choice5"></button>
    </div>

    <div id="town6" class="hidden">
      <p>There aren't many businesses in town. Your directions have led you to the bar.</p>
      <p>A woman is sitting on a wooden chair outside the swinging saloon style door. She looks upset and yells something you don't understand.</p>
      <p>Teffa comes out to meet you. Her eyes widen at the sight of the dinosaur.</p> 
      <p>"I named him Dahgi!" you say.</p> 
      <p id="t">"You.. You're not supposed to treat them like that here..."</p> 
      <p>"Like what?"</p> 
      <p id="t">"Like... pets." Teffa looks embarrassed. "They're food here. It's a taboo."</p>
      <button id="choice6"></button>
    </div>

    <div id="bar7" class="hidden">
      <p>You step inside the bar and ask if she knows what the woman said.</p> 
      <p id="t">"Fuck you. You touch our animals. Keep the bar." Don't take it too personally. People are upset that Monseed installed a company vending machine that only works with our company credit cards.</p> 
      <p>Teffa motions towards a large shiny machine glowing white in the back left corner of the dark bar.</p>
      <p>"Are they allowed to use the vending machine?"</p> 
      <p id="t">Well, I guess so. But it only takes our cards, so they don't.</p>
      <button id="choice7"></button>
    </div>

    <div id="vending8" class="hidden">
      <p>You look at the meals on display in the machine and buy a Monseed garlic pizza.</p>
      <p>Teffa is smiling politely but looks uneasy, which annoys you.</p> 
      <p>You step outside and see Dahgi is still waiting for you. He looks your way but doesn't approach.</p>
      <p>The woman is still siting by the door. She looks you in the eye then looks around. She says something else you don't understand, but she sounds calmer now. The woman accepts the pizza offering and walks away quietly.</p> 
      <p>You go back in the bar and sit next to Teffa on a stool in front of the beer taps.</p>
      <button id="choice8"></button>
    </div>

    <div id="atBar9" class="hidden">
      <p id="t">Well, that was nice of you.</p>
      <p>She smiles nervously. Again you are annoyed, and it shows. Teffa slumps forward.</p>
      <p id="t">Sorry, I know I'm tense. You would be too. I don't know what's going on anymore. I mean, I never knew, but now is different.</p> 
      <p>You feel guilty. She has only been nice to you.</p> 
      <p id="t">I don't know what it is but things are uneasy lately. The vending machine was a bad move. I don't know why they would do that. In private, maybe. But right after the recessive crop deaths? And meat is rationed here. It's just...</p> 
      <p>The tablet buzzes, a notification of your next location. You look at Teffa, apollogetically this time.</p>
      <p id="t">I'll probably get buzzed again soon. Let's have some fun tonight. I'll message you when I get off.</p>
      <button id="choice9"></button>
    </div>

    <div id="job10" class="hidden">
      <p>Dahgi follows you to your next location. Another metal box, but this one's the size of a closet. The brief says to cut all cables then solder the shield to the ground. You open the latch. It's dark inside. Dahgi walks away then comes back with a headlight in his mouth.</p>

      <div id="10b" class="hidden">
        <p>Dahgi drops the headlight in your hand. "Good boy!"</p> 
        <p>You put on the headlamp and walk inside the dark chamber.</p>

      </div>

    </div>

    <div id="wires11" class="hidden">
      <p>You clip the wires and begin stripping them for soldering.</p> 
      <p>The tablet buzzes. Your location has been changed.</p> 
      <p id="finSod">The tablet buzzes four times in rapid succession. Time sensitive exit. But the solder isn't done...</p> 

      <button id='choice11' class="hidden"></button>

    <div id="death11" class="hidden">
        <p>You didn't exit the site on time. It explodes. Dahgi and you are killed.

    <div id="exit12" class="hidden">
      <p>The site explodes behind you. That explains the time sensitive exit notification. You and Dahgi live.</p>
